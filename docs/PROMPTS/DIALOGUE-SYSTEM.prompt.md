# **4. Dialogue System: "Verbal Fencing"**

Combat is rare; dialogue is the primary conflict.

## **The Mechanic:**
When entering a "Dialogue Battle" (e.g., with Polonius), the UI shifts to a combat-like interface.
* **Player Health:** **Credibility.** (If 0, you lose the argument and are dismissed/imprisoned).
* **Enemy Health:** **Composure.** (If 0, they break, reveal a secret, or flee).
## **The Tech Tree (Moveset):**
1. **Direct (Attack):** Standard response. Low damage.
2. **Logic (Heavy Attack):** Requires **Wits**. Pointing out contradictions. High damage to Composure.
3. **Feint (Defense):** Apologize or Flatter. Lowers enemy aggression.
4. **Glitch/Madness (Special):**
	* **Visual:** Text becomes garbled ("Fishmonger!"). Screen tears.
	* **Effect:** Confuses enemy (Stun). Bypasses logic checks.
	* **Cost:** Drains Player's **Resolve** (Sanity).
5. **Equip Item (Critical):**
	* Using a **"Rumor"** (Inventory Item) as a weapon.
	* *Example:* Equipping "Claudius's Letter" against Claudius deals 9999 Composure Damage.
