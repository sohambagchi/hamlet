# **1. Setting: Elsinore Castle**

The game takes place entirely within and immediately around Elsinore Castle. It is a "Clockwork Open World"—a dense, interconnected hub where time passes and characters move according to a daily schedule.

## **The Map Zones:**
* **The Great Hall:** The central hub. Brightly lit, crowded with courtiers. Location for major events (The Play, The Duel).
* **The Royal Quarters:** Claudius and Gertrude’s chambers. High security. Requires "Stealth" or "Madness" to access.
* **The Ramparts:** Cold, blue-tinted, windy. The location of the Ghost. A place for "Soliloquy" (Leveling up).
* **The Library/Study:** Quiet, dusty. The place for research and "Wits" training.
* **The Chapel:** A place of confession. The setting for the pivotal Act 3 "Prayer Scene."
* **The Dungeons & Sewers:** The "Underground" dungeon. Dark, maze-like. Used for sneaking between zones.
* **The Graveyard (Exterior):** Foggy, desolate. A place to find "Relics" (Yorick’s Skull) and the site of the Act 5 brawl.
* **The Harbor/Coast (Exterior):** The exit point for Act 4.

### **Atmosphere:**
The castle changes visually as the Acts progress.
* **Act 1:** Cold, crisp, sterile.
* **Act 3:** Dark shadows, torchlit, claustrophobic.
* **Act 5:** "Rotten." Green tints, fog, decay sprites in the corners.
