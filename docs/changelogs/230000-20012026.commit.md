feat(builder): enhance Sprite Refiner with project checkpoints, box eraser, and UI scaling

## Accomplishments
- **Project Checkpoints**: Implemented full state backup/restore using `.zip` (JSZip). Users can export their current session (source images + pixel edits + labels) and resume it later.
- **UI Scaling**: Added visual `viewScale` control (zoom) in the top bar, allowing users to comfortably edit 64x64 sprites on modern high-res displays without destructive resampling.
- **Enhanced Editing**:
    - Added **Box Eraser** for rapid multi-pixel transparency cleanup.
    - Switched palette extraction to **K-Means Clustering** for cleaner 16-color swatches.
    - Refined 3-column layout with fixed sidebars and auto-scrolling canvas stage.
- **Improved Persistence**:
    - Every sprite chunk now tracks its own Name, Pose, and Canvas Offset in real-time.
    - Added breadcrumb-style "Manual Save" button and **Ctrl+S** shortcut for peace of mind.
    - Decoupled state updates from index changes to prevent metadata "inheritance" bugs.
- **Infrastructure**: Added `jszip` dependency and updated `App.jsx` / `SpriteUploader.jsx` to support dual-entry (New Sheet vs. Resume Project).

## Future Work
- **Canvas Polish**: Add visual "saved" toast notifications.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: More bindings for tool selection (B, E, M, etc.).
- **Batch Export**: A "Zip All Edits" button to bypass individual chunk saves.
