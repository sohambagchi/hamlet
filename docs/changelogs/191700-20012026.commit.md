Setup project skeleton and asset directory structure

Tasks accomplished:
- Created asset directory structure in `public/assets/` including subdirectories for sprites (characters, objects, fx), maps, tilesets, items, and ui.
- Created `docs/GUIDE.md` as the comprehensive Single Source of Truth for the project.
- Initialized `docs/changelogs/` for tracking progress.

Future work:
- Update `Preloader.js` to generate specific placeholders for the new asset categories to avoid loading errors.
- Implement basic Hamlet sprite handling in `Hamlet.js`.
- Begin foundation work for the Dialogue System UI.
