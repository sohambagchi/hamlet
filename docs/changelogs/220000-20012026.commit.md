Phase 3.9: Sprite Refiner Tool Implementation
- Created standalone Sprite Refiner tool at `/builder` route.
- Implemented `SpriteUploader` for uploading and defining grid (Rows x Columns).
- Implemented `SpriteEditor` with:
    - Canvas rendering of 64x64 chunks.
    - Palette generation from sprite colors.
    - Drawing tools: Brush, Eraser.
    - Advanced tools: Move (drag canvas), Paint Bucket (Flood Fill).
    - Onion Skinning (overlay previous sprite).
    - Metadata inputs (Name, Pose) for file naming.
    - Download capability for individual sprites.
- Implemented `sliceImage` utility for auto-slicing and resizing.
- Configured Vite for multi-page app (MPA) support.

Future Work:
- Phase 4: Dialogue Tree Generation.
- Refinement of Sprite Tool based on user feedback (e.g., bulk export, more precise alignment guides).
